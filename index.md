Hello,

This is [Mueez ul-Haq](https://minerva-007.github.io/about), a mechanical engineer, an experienced C++ programmer, and a cybersecurity rookie. I make and break stuff for the fun of it.

Checkout some of these works by me, or head to the [main page](https://minerva-007.github.io/posts) to read some more.
