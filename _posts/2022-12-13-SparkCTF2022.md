Writeups for "ezpz1" and "ezpz2" SparkCTF 2022.
<!--more-->
# Premise
Mid-November, a good friend and teammate (Jeser) in Task_Hashed invited me to stir up some rev challenges for their upcoming SparkCTF 2022: a LAN CTF organized by Engineers Spark Club. I'll be honest: I'm glad to be a part of the technical team. It was a fun and unique experience.

Now let's see what did I make. I made three challenges, two for easy and one for hard category. This post is for easy challenges.

# Challenge: ezpz1

## Description

> The team was really late on schedules, so they decided to add code later.

## Solution

So, there is an ezpz1.exe. The filename gives it away that it is a Portable-Executable file for Windows. Loading on Ghidra gives some good results on `main()` function.

The following snippet from Ghidra's decompiler is of particular interest.

From this snippet, some things are clear:
1. The process obtains a handle to itself.
2. `VirtualProtect()` is used. Even without digging into what `0x38` means in `OpenProcess()`, we get a hint that memory writes are about to be done.
3. `payload` is an 8 byte memory package XOR'd with `0x48`. We'll look into that soon.
4. `WriteProcessMemory()` writes `payload` to `pr`, the same place where `VirtualProtect()` operates. 
5. Most important give-away: `pr()`. `pr` is a function!

Let's dig into what `payload ^ 0x48` results in.

` 0x48, 0x89, 0xC8, 0x48, 0x83, 0xF0, 0x69, 0xC3 `

By using our trustworthy disassembler at defuse.ca, we get following result:

Brushing up our knowledge on fastcall convention, RCX contains the first input and RAX contains the output, so this is equivalent to:

```c++
int pr(int x)
{
return x^0x69;
}
```

And there we have it. From the `for` loop, it can be seen that the output from `pr()` is again XOR'd with the counter `i`, so the complete encryption scheme is deduced.

Following small code is generated after obtaining the data from `ch` variable.

```c++

```

And it will print the result!
