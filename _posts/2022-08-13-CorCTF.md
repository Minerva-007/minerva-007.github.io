2nd CTF, an executable that runs on Windows and Linux, interrupts, and instruction sets.
<!--more-->

# Premise

Right after UIUCTF, I got the honor of teaming up with [Task_Hashed](https://ctftime.org/team/175900) for my 2nd CTF: [corCTF held by Crusaders of Rust](https://ctftime.org/event/1656). On a side note, the name of organizers is befitting of the reputation that Rust has.

I managed to capture one flag in the event, and tried my best with other challenges but didn't succeed in time. I'll be surely sharing writeup for other challs as well, but for now it's time to talk about the forbidden love between two major OS's. 

# Challenge: Windows <3 Linux

## Background info

### Interrupts
Interrupts are, in one way of saying, a neat OS-provided set of functionalities that is available to running processes. Interrupts differ from dynamic libraries or regular functions in following ways:
* A dedicated instruction set (`INT` and `IRET` instead of `CALL` and `RET`)
* Usage of Interrupt Vector Table (in real mode) to maintain a list of function addresses. Dynamic libraries use symbol table or GOTs for this purpose. For protected (x86-64) mode, Interrupt Descriptor Table does the job.
* Higher precedence of interrupt over function. Depending on interrupt functionality, the processor can be locked to not return until the interrupt is completely processed. Functions can, however, be paused mid-execution.

Interrupts are in fact the GOT of the real mode (16-bit) processing. In Windows systems, interrupts are not maintained once switching to protected mode (though IDT can be configured by application independently). In Linux, interrupts are functional in both real and protected mode.

Lastly, Windows use `INT 21h` to perform a majority of tasks (such as I/O) whereas Linux maintains its functions list at `INT 80h`. This can be cleverly used, as explained later.

## Initial Tests

### Symbol table

Let's see what functions this uses.
> cmd> objdump -t m_3l.exe
> 
> m_3l.exe:     file format elf32-i386
> 
> SYMBOL TABLE:
> no symbols

Well, strange. No symbols used. The file header says it's an ELF, so that means this .exe is not supposed to run under Windows (Which uses PE format).

### Executing the function

AS the description says, this is supposed to run on Linux and Windows. The format says it's ELF so let's try from Linux.
Spawning bash on Ubuntu through WSL, we get to work.

> bash> chmod 777 m_3l.exe
>
> bash> ./m_3l.exe
>
> lmaoexdee
>
> Incorrect :( 

Okay, so it requests an input and tells if it is correct or not. 

### strings
Running strings yield some interesting results.

> bash> strings m_3l.exe
>
> >ci!>Uy<cjx<8e,,<p
> 
> Well done! Sadly, Linus Torvalds has embraced, extended and extinguished the other half of the flag :(
>
> $Incorrect :(
>
> $Well done! Sadly, Microsoft has embraced, extended and extinguished the other half of the flag :(
> Incorrect :(

This raises questions. Why are the messages stored twice? Is this executable on both Windows and Linux? Why the file says ELF header, but has extension `.exe`? 

On a side note, the first string seems like a flag. 

### ltrace/strace
Let's try ltrace on this.
> bash> ltrace ./m_3l.exe
>
> Couldn't find .dynsym or .dynstr in "/proc/3645/exe"

Hmmm, no dynamic table. What about strace?

> bash> strace ./m_3l.exe
>
> execve("./m_3l.exe", ["./m_3l.exe"], 0x7ffc9ebbb410 /* 21 vars */) = 0
>

>

> 
> "hello there\n", 255)           = 12
>

>

> 
> exit(0)                                 = ?
> 
> +++ exited with 0 +++

But it surely does I/O. This could mean interrupts.

## Ghidra Attempt #1
Let's open a disassembler. gdb can work fine, but I'll use Ghidra here.
Ghidra identifies it as a ELF x86 file, and after the analysis, here is the dump (using assembly here because of interrupts):
```asembly

        001000c0 cd 80           INT        0x80

```
To understand `INT 80h` calls, here is a summary of what each one does:
* `INT 80h` with `AL=03h`: This is used for taking input. `EBX` mentions input source (0 means keyboard), `ECX` stores the memory location (0x100111) where data will be received, and `DL` stores the number of bytes to read (0xff, or 255).
* `INT 80h` with `AL=04h`: This sends output to console. `EBX` mentions output source (1 means console), `ECX` contains pointer to string data, and `EDX` stores number of bytes to print on console.
* `INT 80h` with `AL=01h`: Exits the system. `EBX` contains return value. Is similar to `exit(reg_EBX)`.

### What the program does
1. Read up to 255 bytes from stdin.
2. Rotates each byte 13 times to the left (due to rotary nature, 13 times mean 13%8=5 times)
3. Compares the result with what is stored at 0x100210. This happens 0x12 or 18 times.
4. Ends with success if answer matches.

So, to reverse this, we obtain 18 bytes of data from 0x100210. That is given as follows:
> unsigned char bytedata1[]={ 0x6c, 0xed, 0x4e, 0x6c, 0x8e, 0xcc, 0x6f, 0x66, 0xad, 0x4c, 0x4e, 0x86, 0x6c, 0x66, 0x85, 0x66, 0x0f, 0x8e };

Using it in the following C code retrieves the flag.
```c
#include"stdio.h"
int main()
{
	unsigned char bytedata1[]={ 0x6c, 0xed, 0x4e, 0x6c, 0x8e, 0xcc, 0x6f, 0x66, 0xad, 0x4c, 0x4e, 0x86, 0x6c, 0x66, 0x85, 0x66, 0x0f, 0x8e };
	for(int i=0;i<sizeof(bytedata1);i++)
		printf("%c",(bytedata1[i] << 3)|(bytedata1[i] >> (8 - 3)));
	return 0;
}
```
And here is the flag:

But but but, that's one half of it.

### Where is the rest?
Continuing past the last `INT 80h` instruction, we find this:

        00100117 00 00           ADD        byte ptr [EAX],AL

```
Many things are confusing here. Why is there a `PUSHFD` in the code? There is no corresponding `POPFD` or otherwise anywhere. There is `INT 21h`, so this should be Windows-executable code. The loop `AND`'s some data with other data and depending on that loads `"Incorrect :("` string. And the code also ends at null bytes.

What seems to be the issue?

## Running on Windows
Trying to run the file on Windows give these results:
> cmd> m_3l.ex
> 
> This version of F:\CTFs\MloveL\m_3l.exe is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information and then contact the software publisher.

Hmmm. It does uses 'INT 21h' so maybe this is not meant for x64 systems. Let's run it on DOSBox, an emulator for DOS.

![DOSBox results](\assets\images\COR-2.png)

I typed in "general kenobi" and it returned with "Incorrect :(" printed. So, this means this file is probably intended to run on DOS system.
Which also means another point: the disassembly done with Ghidra was for x86 (32 bit) code. It should be kept in mind that Intel designs instruction sets with the system mode in mind, such that the processor will always use the largest available register (AX, EAX, or RAX) depending on mode (16 bit, x86, x64). Moreover, being a CISC architecture, the instruction bytes do not have a fixed length, so even one misinterpreted byte can ruin the rest of disassembly.

And that is what happened.

## Ghidra Attempt#2
This time, we'll load the executable as a raw binary image and choose disassembly manually.

![Ghidra](\assets\images\COR-3.png)

Manually going to address 0000:00c2, and requesting a disassembly, we get this code:
```assembly

Bingo, now it makes sense. Here is a review of the `INT 21h` services:
* `INT 21h` with `AH=ah`: `DX` holds the offset to memory address that'll store the maximum number of bytes to read from keyboard, actual number of bytes read, and the buffer to store data. In this context, 0x211 stores 0xff (255 bytes), 0x212 will store length of input, and 0x213 onwards contain the buffer.
* `INT 21h` with `AH=9h`: `DX` holds pointer to a dollar-terminates string, and this is displayed at the console.
* `INT 21h` with `AH=4ch`: Terminates process. Similar to `exit(0)`.

### What this code does
1. Take input from stdin.
2. XOR each input byte with 0xd or 13.
3. Compare with data stored in 0x322. Do this for 0x12 or 18 bytes.
4. End with success if bytes match.

### Code
Surprisingly, the data stored at 0x322 is what we found with strings: `>ci!>Uy<cjx<8e,,<p`. So, this C code will help.
```c++
#include"stdio.h"
#include"string.h"
int main()
{
	char ch[]=">ci!>Uy<cjx<8e,,<p";
	for(int i=0;i<strlen(ch);i++)
	printf("%c",ch[i]^0xd);
	return 0;
}
```
And here is the output:

This is the 2nd part of the flag. Nice.


## Extra info
* DOS executables often start with MZ header, showing the starting location of code segment. I couldn't find such header, so I am confused as for how this ELF header file executed under DOS environment. 
* `INT` service can be used to identify if a program is intended to run under Linux or Windows. Of course, programs sometimes have the freedom to change the IVT/IDT, but many a times these are standardized services and so programs don't mess around.
* Selecting correct disassembler is critical, because extension prefixes in modern CPUs can provide wrong info when analyzing 16-bit code!
