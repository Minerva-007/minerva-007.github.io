Writeups for "ezpz1", "ezpz2" and "VM" SparkCTF 2022.
<!--more-->
# Premise
Mid-November, a good friend and teammate (Jeser) in Task_Hashed invited me to stir up some rev challenges for their upcoming SparkCTF 2022: a LAN CTF organized by Engineers Spark Club. I'll be honest: I'm glad to be a part of the technical team. It was a fun and unique experience.

Now let's see what did I make. I made three challenges, two for easy and one for hard category. 

# Challenge: ezpz1

## Description

> The team was really late on schedules, so they decided to add code later.

You can access the binaries [here](https://github.com/Minerva-007/SparkCTF2022/tree/main/EzPz1).

## Solution

So, there is an ezpz1.exe. The filename gives it away that it is a Portable-Executable file for Windows. Loading on Ghidra gives some good results on `main()` function.

The following snippet from Ghidra's decompiler is of particular interest.
![main](\assets\images\Spark1-1.png)

From this snippet, some things are clear:
1. The process obtains a handle to itself.
2. `VirtualProtect()` is used. Even without digging into what `0x38` means in `OpenProcess()`, we get a hint that memory writes are about to be done.
3. `payload` is an 8 byte memory package XOR'd with `0x48`. We'll look into that soon.
4. `WriteProcessMemory()` writes `payload` to `pr`, the same place where `VirtualProtect()` operates. 
5. Most important give-away: `pr()`. `pr` is a function!

Let's dig into what `payload ^ 0x48` results in.

`0x48, 0x89, 0xC8, 0x48, 0x83, 0xF0, 0x69, 0xC3`

By using our trustworthy disassembler at defuse.ca, we get following result:

![disasm](\assets\images\Spark1-2.png)

Brushing up our knowledge on fastcall convention, RCX contains the first input and RAX contains the output, so this is equivalent to:

```c++
int pr(int x)
{
return x^0x69;
}
```

And there we have it. From the `for` loop, it can be seen that the output from `pr()` is again XOR'd with the counter `i`, so the complete encryption scheme is deduced.

Following small code is generated after obtaining the data from `ch` variable.

```c++
#include"stdio.h"

int main()
{
	char ch[]={ 0x0b, 0x50, 0x58, 0x0f, 0x5a, 0x0e, 0x5e, 0x57, 0x56, 0x01, 0x57, 0x5b, 0x5c, 0x00, 0x55, 0x56, 0x4c, 0x19, 0x42, 0x48, 0x1b, 0x4c, 0x4b, 0x1c, 0x47, 0x41, 0x47, 0x45, 0x10, 0x41, 0x4f, 0x44, 0x71, 0x70, 0x7a, 0x29, 0x79, 0x74, 0x7e, 0x7b, 0x77, 0x70, 0x7a, 0x75, 0x7c, 0x7c, 0x25, 0x74, 0x68, 0x6b, 0x6a, 0x3f, 0x6d, 0x6d, 0x39, 0x6a, 0x68, 0x63, 0x64, 0x34, 0x37, 0x37, 0x31, 0x32 };
	printf("SparkCTF{");
	for(int i=0;i<sizeof(ch);i++)
	{
		printf("%c",ch[i]^0x69^i);
	}
	printf("}\n");
	return 0;
}
```

And it will print the Flag!

# Challenge: ezpz2

## Description

> Hopscotch or something idk I never left my room.

You can access the binaries [here](https://github.com/Minerva-007/SparkCTF2022/tree/main/EzPz2).

## Solution

This is an elf file (Ghidra said so) and decompiling and preprocessing lands us into the `main()` function. 

![main](\assets\images\Spark1-3.png)

Interesting piece of code. Major interest is in `arr` and `selector()`. Let's decompile `selector()` and see what is there.
```c++
/* selector(int, char) */

int selector(int index,char chara)

{
  char cVar1;
  int iVar2;
  
  switch(index % 5) {
  case 0:
    cVar1 = one(chara);
    iVar2 = (int)cVar1;
    break;
  case 1:
    cVar1 = two(chara);
    iVar2 = (int)cVar1;
    break;
  case 2:
    cVar1 = three(chara);
    iVar2 = (int)cVar1;
    break;
  case 3:
    cVar1 = four(chara);
    iVar2 = (int)cVar1;
    break;
  case 4:
    cVar1 = five(chara);
    iVar2 = (int)cVar1;
    break;
  default:
    iVar2 = 0x45;
  }
  return iVar2;
}
```
Luckily, Ghidra converted the spaghetti of assembly code into a nice switch-case ladder. From this, we can note:

1. The remainder from `index` is obtained and is used in switch-case ladder.
2. `chara` is passed on to a different function in each case: conveniently named `one()`, `two()`, `three()`, `four()`, and `five()`.

Let's summarize what each function does, according to Ghidra, here:

### one

```c++
int one(char param_1)

{
  return (byte)param_1 + 1;
}

```

### two

```c++
byte two(char param_1)

{
  return param_1 ^ 0x73;
}
```

### three

```c++
void three(char param_1)

{
  four(param_1 + -0x56);
  return;
}

```

### four

```c++
byte four(char param_1)

{
  return param_1 ^ 0x7b;
}
```

### five

```c++
char five(char param_1)

{
  return param_1;
}

```

Armed with what every function does, and what is the underlying logic, we retrieve bytes from `arr` and write a solver.

```c++
#include"stdio.h"

int solve(int index, char ch)
{
	switch(index%5)
	{
		//Idea is to revert what is done in the above functions
		case 0: return ch-1;
		case 1: return ch^0x73;
		case 2: return (ch^0x7b) + 0x56;
		case 3: return ch^0x7b;
		case 4: return ch;
		default: return ch;
	}
	return ch;
}


int main()
{
	unsigned char arr[]={ 0x62, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x42, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x76, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x1f, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x62, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x62, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x15, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xa0, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0x4f, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x33, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x32, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x46, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x77, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x4b, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x36, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x64, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x17, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x76, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x1d, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x38, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x36, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x46, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x70, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x4d, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x30, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x67, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x41, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x6b, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x48, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x64, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x39, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x45, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x70, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x1d, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x38, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x64, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x17, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x76, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x1e, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x61, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x66, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x4b, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x98, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0x43, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x38, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x67, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x17, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x70, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x4a, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x64, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x34, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x44, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x98, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0x48, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x38, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x63, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x17, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x70, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x1f, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x36, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x65, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x40, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x6b, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
	printf("SparkCTF{");
	for(int i=0;i<sizeof(arr)/4;i++)
	{
		printf("%c",solve(i,arr[i*4]));
	}
	printf("}\n");
	return 0;
}
```

And with that, the flag is nicely retrieved.

# Challenge: VM

## Description

> You came across a computer with a strange architecture, and it asks you to insert 2kB of RAM. Upon insertion, it just says "Nopity Nope". Can you figure out anything else?

You can access the binaries [here](https://github.com/Minerva-007/SparkCTF2022/tree/main/Virtual%20Machine).

## Solution

This challenge comes with two files: VM and Memory. Let's take a look at VM first.

Loading VM on Ghidra reveals it is an ELF binary. The `main()` function looks like this:

```c++
undefined8 main(void)

{
  FILE *pFVar1;
  undefined8 uVar2;
  int local_14;
  
  pFVar1 = fopen("Memory","r");
  if (pFVar1 == (FILE *)0x0) {
    puts("Cannot load memory.");
    uVar2 = 0xffffffff;
  }
  else {
    for (local_14 = 0; local_14 < 0x800; local_14 = local_14 + 1) {
      __isoc99_fscanf(pFVar1,&DAT_00102021,MEMORY + (long)local_14 * 4);
    }
    runner();
    if (MEMORY._1020_4_ == 0x119) {
      puts("Correct!");
    }
    else {
      puts("Nopity Nope.");
    }
    uVar2 = 0;
  }
  return uVar2;
}
```

So, from this, it can be seen that this function:

1. Reads 2kb data from `Memory` file and saves it into `MEMORY` global variable.
2. Calls `runner()`.
3. Tests if the value at `MEMORY[255]` is `0x119` or not.

That being said, let's look at `runner()`.

### runner()

```c++
void runner(void)
{
  uint locA;
  uint locB;
  long valA;
  uint counter;
  uint locC;
  
  counter = 500;
  locC = counter;
  while (counter = locC, counter != 0x7ff) {
    locA = *(uint *)(MEMORY + (long)(int)counter * 4) ^ 0x42 ^ counter;
    valA = (long)(int)locA;
    locB = (counter + 1) ^ *(uint *)(MEMORY + (long)(int)(counter + 1) * 4) ^ 0x42;
    locC = *(uint *)(MEMORY + (long)(int)(counter + 2) * 4);
    *(uint *)(MEMORY + valA * 4) =
         (locA ^ *(uint *)(MEMORY + valA * 4) ^ 0x42) -
         (locB ^ *(uint *)(MEMORY + (long)(int)locB * 4) ^ 0x42) ^ 0x42 ^ locA;
    locC = (counter + 2) ^ locC ^ 0x69;
    if (valA != (int)(*(uint *)(MEMORY + valA * 4) ^ 0x42)) {
      locC = counter + 3;
    }
  }
  return;
}
```

I renamed the variables to make much more sense out of it. Meanwhile, here is a written description of what happens:
1. `locA` contains the value written at `counter` XOR'd with `0x42` and `counter`
2. `locB` contains the value written at `counter+1` XOR'd with `0x42` and `counter+1`
3. `locC` contains the value written at `counter+2` XOR'd with `0x69` and `counter+2`.
4. `valA`, `valB` and `valC` are simply `long int` conversions from `unsigned int` datatype and is a technicality of Ghidra.
5. The complicated mathematics boil down to this: `MEMORY[valA] = ( (MEMORY[valA]^0x42^valA) - (MEMORY[valB]^0x42^valB) ) ^0x42^valA;`
6. The `if` block is a test of comparing the variable with itself, and logically is equivalent to comparing a variable with 0. So, the if block tests if the value at `MEMORY[valA]` is zero or not. If it is zero, then `counter` begins with the value at `loc3`. If it is not zero, then `counter` is incremented by 0x3.
7. The starting value of `counter` is 500, and it loops until counter reaches `0x7ff`.

That's a lot to digest, so here's a snippet from original source code to understand:
```c++
void runner()
{
	int index=500;
	while(index!=2047)
	{
		//Read 3 values
		long int mem1=MEMORY[index]^0x042^index;
		long int mem2=MEMORY[index+1]^0x042^(index+1);
		long int mem3=MEMORY[index+2]^0x069^(index+2);
		MEMORY[mem1] = ((MEMORY[mem1]^0x042^mem1)-(MEMORY[mem2]^0x042^mem2))^0x042^mem1;
		if((MEMORY[mem1]^0x042^mem1)==0){
			index = mem3;
		}
		else{
			index = index +3;
		}
		
	}
}
```

Some searching indicates that this is a type of an OISC, or one instruction set computer. 

### Memory

From the above function, it looks reasonable to look at `Memory` now. Starting at the memory address 500, we can start reading the memory contents and try to understand what is going on. Here is a function that disassembles the memory. 

```c++
void runner()
{
	int index=500;
	while(index<2047)
	{
		//Read 3 values
		long int mem1=MEMORY[index]^0x042^index;
		long int mem2=MEMORY[index+1]^0x042^(index+1);
		long int mem3=MEMORY[index+2]^0x069^(index+2);
		printf("%d:\t\tSUBEQ %d, %d, %d\n",index,mem1, mem2, mem3);
			index = index +3;
	}
}
```

The disassembly produces quite some output, so here only selected parts are discussed.

### Patch 1
```
500:            SUBEQ 499, 256, 503
503:            SUBEQ 256, 499, 506
506:            SUBEQ 420, 2046, 512
509:            SUBEQ 2047, 2047, 503
512:            SUBEQ 499, 499, 515
515:            SUBEQ 499, 257, 518
```
For reference, the values are as follows: `499: 0`, `420: 75`, '2046: 1`, `2047: 0`.
So, this code loads value at 256 into 499 (line 500 loads -ve value, and line 503 loads it again, so 0-(-x)=x ), and keeps on adding value at 256 to itself as long as value at 420 doesn't get to 0 (it is at 75 currently, and line 506 subtracts one). 

From here, it can be seen that the value at 256 is added (value at 420)times. This is same as multiplying the two values. Note that since it counts down to 0, this actually multiplies by one more (in this example, it is multiplied by 76 and not 75). This snippet is repetitive till line 1457.

### Patch 2
```
1460:           SUBEQ 0, 256, 1466
1463:           SUBEQ 2047, 2047, 2047
1466:           SUBEQ 1, 257, 1472
1469:           SUBEQ 2047, 2047, 2047
1472:           SUBEQ 2, 258, 1478
1475:           SUBEQ 2047, 2047, 2047
```
Here, the values at memory location 0 and 256 are subtracted. If answer is zero, the it jumps to next comparison, otherwise it jumps to 2047.

If you followed, the decompilation of `runner()` showed that the execution stops when counter is 2047. This patch continues until line 1844 which says:

`1844:           SUBEQ 2047, 2047, 65`

So, let's move to line 65.

```
65:             SUBEQ 255, 254, 68
68:             SUBEQ 2047, 2047, 2047
```
So, this moves whatever is at memory location 254 to memory location 255 and stops execution.

### SUMMARY SO FAR

The code, albeit complicated in implementation, basically multiplies the 64 bytes from 256 onwards with 64 bytes at 420 onwards, and checks if it matches the 64 bytes at 0. Now, here are the values at 420 and 0.
 
```c++
for(int i=0;i<64;i++)
	{
		printf("%d %d\n",MEMORY[i]^0x042^i, MEMORY[i+420]^(i+420)^0x042);
	}
```
From here, by dividing the first column with second column, the flag can be retrieved. All that's left is to write the values correctly at memory location 256 onwards.

The disassembler.cpp in the link above handles all the code nicely.

# Before we go

In the last challenge, the following secret key was stored at memory location 420: `KanonClannadCharotteAngelBeatsPlasticMemoriesPlanetarianAllKey<3`. Yea nothing much, just wanted to throw a shout to my favourite anime xD.
