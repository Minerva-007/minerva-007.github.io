My first ever CTF, a look into DLL initializations, and some interesting views
<!--more-->
# Premise
After getting completely destroyed in Google CTF, I joined [JHDiscord team](https://ctftime.org/team/62434) for my 2nd CTF: [UIUCTF held by SIGPwny](https://ctftime.org/event/1600). The theme was a gallery of prompt-based generated images, and each displayed image had a challenge associated with it.
I captured a single flag in the event, and this is the writeup for that. I'll try other challs and share their writeups too (subject to motivation).

## Prior knowledge

### DLLs

The provided file is a dynamic link library, which consist of compiled functions, a symbol table to aid in exporting functions, and an initializer that is called when the DLL is loaded. The Linux equivalent are .so libraries, and these also feature their entry points.

### How DLL loading works

Windows provide two main functions, namely `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddr` in `kernel32.dll` to aid in loading and linking to DLLs. Whenever `LoadLibrary` is called, the function looks for the requested library, loads it into the memory if it is called for the first time, calls `DllMain` to let DLL handle file-specific initializations and checks, and returns the handle to caller program.
`GetProcAddr` then accepts a string and uses the symbol table to find the address of requested procedure. The caller program then calls the address to use the function.

> So, when reversing a DLL, following things are to be noted:
* What functions does it export?
* What is happening in the entry point function?

## Initial tests

### Symbol table

Retrieving symbol table using objdump, we get
> cmd> objdump -t iv.dll
> 
> iv.dll:	file format pei-x86-64
> 
> SYMBOL TABLE:
> no symbols

Hmmmmm, no symbols. That's strange for a DLL whose purpose is to export functions. This hints towards a DLL with code segment solely lying in DllMain.

### Using a DLL

Using a DLL requires a loader program. The following C++ code does this.

```c++
#include"windows.h"//for LoadLibrary and FreeLibrary
#include"stdlib.h" //for system
int main()
{
	HMODULE hm=LoadLibrary("IV.dll");
	FreeLibrary(hm);
	return 0;
}
```

Let's see the output for this program. Using g++ to compile,
> cmd> g++ load.cpp -o loader.exe
> 
> cmd> loader
> 
> Failed! 
> 
> Press any key to continue...

As guessing from previous results, the program only used `LoadLibrary` and we got console output. This hints more towards DllMain bearing the executable code and being our point of interest.

### strings
Running `strings` is a good idea for files, since that provides a list of inputs/output prompts that may occur in execution, and also produces the import-export tables which help in hinting at program functionality. Here's a selected output from the command.
> cmd> strings iv.dll
> 
> ...

Let's break this down piecewise.

From the loading test done priorly, we know that 'Failed!' is an output string. So, this section should be data header, and that makes `IS7WXGC726Z9JZMFPOKWQVMEPJCSU2FIMAC5N2VYIPGFJPCZPROPMYNL` the potential flag, albeit obfuscated. `/Room2004` and `/Sigpwnie.exe` seem to be a filepath and executable name, which could be the requirement of the DLL to load successfully. 

Lastly, there are calls to `GetUserProfileDirectoryW`, which returns user directory `C:\Users\user-name` as a UTF-16 string (the `W` in function name). `GetModuleFileName` returns the name of the base module (in context of a DLL: the loader program) as a string.

This opens a few things.

## Ghidra time
> My favourite scene in Game of Thrones was when John Snow fought the dragon and screamed, "It's Ghidra Time!".

Loading the DLL in Ghidra and checking out `dllmain_dispatch`, we are directed towards a couple of jumps that lead to this function at memory address `0x180013860`. Here's a decompiled version of it.
```c++
undefined8 FUN_180013860(LPVOID param_1,int param_2)

{
  HANDLE hObject;    //Windows HANDLE file
  
  __CheckForDebuggerJustMyCode(&DAT_18002c0a0);  //Visual Studio added this
  if (param_2 == 1) {
    hObject = CreateThread((LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES)0x0,0,(LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)&LAB_18001100a,
                           param_1,0,(LPDWORD)0x0);   //Create a thread 
    CloseHandle(hObject);   //close the object
  }
  return 1;   //Return OK
}

```
The function `__CheckForDebuggerJustMyCode` is added by Visual Studio as a part of debug info, and is intended to help in debugging process. Our focus is on `CreateThread`, which launchs a thread to execute some code while the library sets on its way to complete the initialization process by the `return 1;` statement.

Let's see where it leads.

After another jump, it leads to following function (hereby named OG_Injection by me).

```c++
void OG_Injection(void)

  __CheckForDebuggerJustMyCode(&DAT_18002c0a0);

  _MaxCount = (ulonglong)local_96c;
  pcVar2 = local_d80;
  local_94c = strncmp(local_11a0,pcVar2,_MaxCount);
  if (local_94c == 0) {
    thunk_FUN_180013b90(local_928,(longlong)local_8c8);
    _memccpy(local_850,local_8c8,0x7d,local_878);
    local_5c = MessageBoxA((HWND)0x0,local_850,"Success",0);
    thunk_FUN_180013050(local_678);

    thunk_FUN_1800187f0(local_28 ^ (ulonglong)local_1a70);
    return;
  }
  thunk_FUN_1800139d0("Failed!\n",pcVar2,_MaxCount,in_R9);
  system("pause");
  FreeLibraryAndExitThread(in_stack_00000000,0);
}

```

That's quite a code, so here's a summary of what it does.

1. The first few loops are initializations, zeroing the arrays using `rep stosb` and similar mnemonics. The stack location `local_928' stores the potential flag.
2. The handle of current process is obtained using `GetCurrentProcess`
3. The Token for Query Access rights (8 in 2nd argument) is obtained.
4. The user's home directory (`C:\Users\username\`) is retrieved.
5. The UTF-16 encoding is converted into ASCII formatting using jumps leading to `convertUTF16toMultiByte`.
6. The obtained strings are joined together to form a path of the form `C:\Users\username\Room2004\Sigpwny.exe`
7. The loader program's filename with complete path is retrieved using `GetModuleFileNameA`
8. A comparison is done. If module filename matches what is stored earlier, then the flag is displayed using `MessageBoxA`, otherwise an exception is thrown with "Failed" being dumped on console.

From here, two routes lead.

## Route 1: Fulfill the conditions
The easiest way to capture the flag is to fulfill the filepath requirement. Here is a script that does this.
```
c:
cd Users
cd username
mkdir Room2004
cd Room2004
copy C:\Users\username\Downloads\IV.dll C:\Users\username\Room2004
copy C:\Users\username\documents\loader.cpp C:\Users\username\Room2004
g++ loader.cpp -o Sigpwny.exe
Sigpwny
```

And here is the output:

### Flag won, but at what cost?
Did we get the flag by completing the requirements for the DLL? Yes. Is this the right way? Debatable, but in practice making an unknown DLL execute on your system is a bad idea. VMs and sandbox can provide a barrier for that, so that is recommended. Static analysis is a better idea too.

And this is why there is a

## Route 2: reverse the flag
The flag obfuscation is pretty complex, so that'd be handled in a separate post.

## Extra info
* There are stack protection checks within each function, which is added by the compiler.
* Almost all of the error handling is done through throwing exceptions, which leads to a set of functions being executed and finally the error message being dumped at stderr (i.e. console, unless a log file is introduced).
* Given how much effort is placed in obfuscating the flag, keeping the kernel calls and DLL loading criteria in plaintext seems to be the intended solution. However, as noted above, this should not be done when working with live DLLs and proper sandboxing should be done.
