# Premise
After getting completely destroyed in Google CTF, I joined [JHDiscord team](https://ctftime.org/team/62434) for my 2nd CTF: [UIUCTF held by SIGPwny](https://ctftime.org/event/1600). The theme was a gallery of prompt-based generated images, and each displayed image had a challenge associated with it.
I captured a single flag in the event, and this is the writeup for that. I'll try other challs and share their writeups too (subject to motivation).

# Challenge: Reject to Inject
> "a sad little foal, cute, watery eyes, ultra detailed, octane render"
## Description
> Seems like the patient is afraid of needles. Can you go help him?
