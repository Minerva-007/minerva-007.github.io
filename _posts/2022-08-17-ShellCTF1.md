Writeups for ShellCTF rev category. Easier ones.
<!--more-->
# Premise
The team Task_Hashed participated in [ShellCTF 2022](https://ctftime.org/event/1604) which was a beginner-friendly CTF by shellpwn, and we were able to capture all the flags! We ended up at #18 due to time, but 100% completion is a feat in itself. This is a writeup for the rev category of the CTF.

This post only deals with simpler challenges, so almost all solutions will be just "open and run".

# Challenge: How to defeat a dragon

## Description

> "Dragonairre,the dragon with the hexadecimal head has attacked the village to take revenge on his last defeat,we need to get the ultimate weapon."

## Solution

Running strings yields the flag. The flag is in hexadecimal notation.
> SHELLCTFH
> {5348454H
> c4c43544H
> 67b31355H
> f5233763H
> 37235316H
> e675f333H
> 473793f7H
> []A\A]A^A_

Using CyberChef or any other hex to ascii converter, we get the flag as `SHELLCTF{15_R3v3r51ng_34sy?}`.
The intended solution is to find the passcode for the interface, which is 69420 (and can be found using Ghidra).

# Challenge: Pulling the strings

## Description

> "Can you please feed me something?"

## Solution

Running strings doesn't yield anything interesting. However, mentioning UTF-32 yields interesting results. The command is `strings -e L filename`.

The program stores the flag as UTF-32, and takes the flag as input as well. It returns a "Thank you!" if correct flag is inputted.

# Challenge: keygen

> "Enter the code and get the flag."

## Solution
I had a look at the intended solution (found [here](https://github.com/S-H-E-L-L/S.H.E.L.L-CTF-2022/blob/main/rev/keygen/Solution/Solution.md) ) and the intention was to generate any valid key that fulfills the checksum. However, a side channel attack was easier in this case.
Opening the program in Ghidra, we get a function `getString` that loads the flag, one byte at a time. From here, the flag can be retrieved.

```c++
undefined * getString(void)

{
  undefined *puVar1;
  
  puVar1 = (undefined *)malloc(0x19);
  *puVar1 = 0x53;
  puVar1[1] = 0x48;
  puVar1[2] = 0x45;
  puVar1[3] = 0x4c;
  puVar1[4] = 0x4c;
  puVar1[5] = 0x43;
  puVar1[6] = 0x54;
  puVar1[7] = 0x46;
  puVar1[8] = 0x7b;
  puVar1[9] = 0x6b;
  puVar1[10] = 0x33;
  puVar1[0xb] = 0x79;
  puVar1[0xc] = 0x67;
  puVar1[0xd] = 0x65;
  puVar1[0xe] = 0x6e;
  puVar1[0xf] = 0x5f;
  puVar1[0x10] = 0x31;
  puVar1[0x11] = 0x73;
  puVar1[0x12] = 0x5f;
  puVar1[0x13] = 99;
  puVar1[0x14] = 0x30;
  puVar1[0x15] = 0x6f;
  puVar1[0x16] = 0x4c;
  puVar1[0x17] = 0x7d;
  puVar1[0x18] = 0;
  return puVar1;
}
```
The flag is `SHELLCTF{k3ygen_1s_c0oL}`.

# Challenge: Warmup

## Solution

Opening it in Ghidra yields following `main()`.
```c++
undefined8 main(void)
{
  bool bVar1;
  size_t sVar2;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int local_ac;
  int local_a8 [28];
  char local_38 [40];
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  printf("enter the flag: ");
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00102015,local_38);
  sVar2 = strlen(local_38);
  if (sVar2 == 27) {
    local_a8[0] = 0x1cc;
    local_a8[1] = 0x1a0;
    local_a8[2] = 0x194;
    local_a8[3] = 0x1b0;
    local_a8[4] = 0x1b0;
    local_a8[5] = 0x18c;
    local_a8[6] = 0x1d0;
    local_a8[7] = 0x198;
    local_a8[8] = 0x1ec;
    local_a8[9] = 0x188;
    local_a8[10] = 0xc4;
    local_a8[11] = 0x1d0;
    local_a8[12] = 0x15c;
    local_a8[13] = 0x1a4;
    local_a8[14] = 0xd4;
    local_a8[15] = 0x194;
    local_a8[16] = 0x17c;
    local_a8[17] = 0xc0;
    local_a8[18] = 0x1c0;
    local_a8[19] = 0xcc;
    local_a8[20] = 0x1c8;
    local_a8[21] = 0x104;
    local_a8[22] = 0x1d0;
    local_a8[23] = 0xc0;
    local_a8[24] = 0x1c8;
    local_a8[25] = 0x14c;
    local_a8[26] = 500;
    bVar1 = true;
    for (local_ac = 0; local_ac < 27; local_ac = local_ac + 1) {
      bVar1 = (bool)(bVar1 & local_a8[local_ac] >> 2 == (int)local_38[local_ac]);
    }
    if (bVar1) {
      puts("yes, that\'s it");
    }
    else {
      puts("nah that\'s not it");
    }
  }
  else {
    puts("wrong length");
  }
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
So, the list of 27 bytes are being right shifted to be compared with what is entered as input. So, left-shifting this data will give the flag.

Following hacky code does the same thing.

```c++
#include"stdio.h"

int main()
{
	int v6[27];
	v6[0] = 460;
	v6[1] = 416;
	v6[2] = 404;
	v6[3] = 432;
	v6[4] = 432;
	v6[5] = 396;
	v6[6] = 464;
	v6[7] = 408;
	v6[8] = 492;
	v6[9] = 392;
	v6[10] = 196;
	v6[11] = 464;
	v6[12] = 348;
	v6[13] = 420;
	v6[14] = 212;
	v6[15] = 404;
	v6[16] = 380;
	v6[17] = 192;
	v6[18] = 448;
	v6[19] = 204;
	v6[20] = 456;
	v6[21] = 260;
	v6[22] = 464;
	v6[23] = 192;
	v6[24] = 456;
	v6[25] = 332;
	v6[26] = 500;
	for(int i=0;i<27;i++)
		printf("%c",v6[i]>>2);
	return 0;
}
```

The flag is `shellctf{b1tWi5e_0p3rAt0rS}`.
