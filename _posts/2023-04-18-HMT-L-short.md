# Premise
The objective was to place ten tubes in a tube tank to ensure that maximum heat transfer was obtained. [FEATool Multiplysics](https://www.featool.com/) was used in adjunct with MATLAB, OpenFOAM, and gmsh to obtain results. 14 configurations were heuristically derived and tested in a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation coupled with heat transfer. The results were contradictory with the existing literature due to the sparse nature of the problem domain.
