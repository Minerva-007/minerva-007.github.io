# About

Hello there, this is Mueez-ul-Haq (aka Minerva.). I am a mechanical engineer (mastery in thermal power), a long-time programmer, and a diehard fan of anime and Doom. 

### Mechanical Engineering
My capstone project in my bachelors degree was related to renewable energy, and I presented my work in ICERD-8 organized in Kuwait in November 2023.
Currently I am a teaching assistant in MED UET LHR, and a ECoE scholarship awardee by QATPL Bhikki. My masters programme involves internship in the 1180MW combined cycle power plant for a year.
My core competencies are:
- Renewable energy resources
	- Resource assessment, prediction, utilization.
- Computational Engineering 
	- Metaheuristics, Monte Carlo solvers, classical techniques.
- Thermofluid simulations
- Design Engineering (machine and mechanisms)
- Design for Manufacturing

Tools: MATLAB, Simulink, Arduino, SOLIDWORKS, Ricardo WAVE, EES, MathCAD, PVSyst, Siemens PLM.

### Programming (C/C++)
From writing stupid proofs of concept codes to making sophisticated simulations, I have experimented a lot in my past 10 years.
- Game Development
- High Performance Computing
- Network Programming
- Compiler Construction
- Bash/PS scripting

Tools: gcc, g++, masm, cmd/powershell, bash, vim winsock/winGDI.

Environments: Visual Studio, Dev-cpp, Ubuntu@WSL.

### Cybersecurity
I used to participate in jeopardy-style CTFs in rev/pwn category from August 2022 to March 2023. I still remember a few things, however. I was an active player for [/bin/cat](https://ctftime.org/team/211363) and sometimes [JHDiscord](https://ctftime.org/team/62434).

Tools: Ghidra, IDA, gdb, CyberChef, Ubuntu@WSL.
