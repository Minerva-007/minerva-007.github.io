# Who am I?

Hello there, this is Mueez-ul-Haq (aka Minerva-007). Dabbling through several domains, I excel in mechanical engineering, computer programming, and reverse engineering. 

## What I do

### Mechanical Engineering
My major is in renewable energy resources, with a paper published in my university's conference. Following is a list of interests:
- Renewable energy resources
	- Resource assessment, prediction, utilization.
- Thermofluid simulations
- Design Engineering (machine and mechanisms)
- Design for Manufacturing
- Computational Engineering 
	- Metaheuristics, Monte Carlo solvers, classical techniques.

### Computer Programming
Developing programs to learn technologies that can help me in daily life is the theme behind my scripts. Following are my interests:
- Algorithms, Data Structures
- Network Programming
- Compiler Construction
- Bash/PS scripting

### Cybersecurity
I participate in jeopardy-style CTFs in rev/pwn category, as well as practice weekly. I play for [Task_Hashed](https://ctftime.org/team/175900) and sometimes [JHDiscord](https://ctftime.org/team/62434).
